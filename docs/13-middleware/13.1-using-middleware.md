## 13.1 - Using middleware

Middleware provides a convenient mechanism to alter the input data before validation. You can trim all whitespace or add a leading zero to date inputs etc. Modern PHP Validator comes with predefined middleware which you can use, or you can create your [own custom middleware](#custom-middleware).

*Note: When retrieving the validated data with the `validatedData()` method, the altered values by the executed middleware will be returned.*

### Predefined middleware

Modern PHP Validator comes with predefined middleware which you can use.



#### Example 1:

In the example below we define the `toLowercase` and `trim` middleware and attach it to all the elements inside the "email" field.

Before a single rule is executed, the middleware will take the value of the field and convert and set the new value for the validation rules to work with.

```php
$data = [
    'emails' => [
        '  MORRIS@domain.com    ', //Note the spaces and capital letters
        ' Smith@domain.com '
    ]
];

$validator = new Validator($data);
$validator->field('emails.*')->email()->lengthBetween(5, 50);

//Attach the lowercase and trim middleware
$validator
    ->middleware('emails.*')
    ->toLowercase()
    ->trim(); 

if($validator->passes()) {
    
    $validator->validatedData()->toArray();
    /*
	'emails' => [
		'morris@domain.com',
		'smith@domain.com'
	]
    */
}
```

As you can see, the validation passes and the validated data is returning the array with emails converted to lower-case and without spaces around the email addresses.
