## 10.1 - Working with validated data

### Returning only validated data

After validation, you can retrieve the data that has been validated. This is different from the given data, because it will only return the data where validation rules were applied.

```php
$data = [
    'username' => 'Morris', 
    'password' => '123'
];

$validator = new Validator($data);
$validator
    ->field('username')
    ->lengthMin(3)
    ->lengthMax(10)
    ->isString();

$validator->execute(); //Without executing, there is no validated data

$validator
    ->validatedData()
    ->toArray(); //Array('username' => 'Morris')
```
