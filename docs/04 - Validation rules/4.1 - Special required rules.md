## 4.1 - Special "required" rules

Before explaining all the rules, you need to know the existence of the special "required" rules. These rules are special because they can disable (bail) other rules based on if the input is empty or not.

A field is considered "empty" if one of the following conditions are true:

- The value is `null`;
- The value is an empty `string`;
- The value is an empty `array` or empty `countable` object.



### Required

The field under validation must be present in the input data and not empty.

In this example, the `minLength()` rule will not be executed, because the `required()` method prevents the `minLength` rule to be executed (bailing), due to the fact that the surname is considered `empty`.



#### Example 1:

```php
use KrisKuiper\Validator\Validator;

$data = ['surname' => ''];
$validator = new Validator($data);
$validator->field('surname')->required()->lengthMin(5);
```

*Note: validation will fail in this example, because the surname is required, but not provided*.



#### Example 2:

This validation will pass because the surname is only checked with the `minLength` rule when the field is not empty (which it is):

```php
use KrisKuiper\Validator\Validator;

$data = ['surname' => ''];
$validator = new Validator($data);
$validator->field('surname')->required(false)->lengthMin(5);
```



### Required with

The field under validation must be present and not empty *only if* any of the other specified fields are present and not empty.

```php
use KrisKuiper\Validator\Validator;

$data = [
    'surname' => '', 
    'middle_name' => 'Elizabeth', 
    'lastname' => ''
];

$validator = new Validator($data);
$validator->field('surname')->requiredWith('middle_name', 'lastname');
```

*Note: validation will fail in this example, because the surname is required because of the middle name field, but it is not provided*.



### Required with all

The field under validation must be present and not empty *only if* all the other specified fields are present and not empty.

```php
use KrisKuiper\Validator\Validator;

$data = [
    'age' => null,
    'name' => 'Brenda',
    'date' => [
        'day' => 1,
        'month' => null,
        'year' => 2000
    ]
];

$validator = new Validator($data);
$validator->field('age')->requiredWithAll('name', 'date.*');
```

*Note: validation will pass in this example, because the month field is empty, so the age field is not required*.



### Required without

The field under validation must be present and not empty *only when* any of the other specified fields are empty or not present.

```php
use KrisKuiper\Validator\Validator;

$data = [
    'age' => '',
    'name' => 'Morris',
];

$validator = new Validator($data);
$validator->field('age')->requiredWithout('name');
```

*Note: validation will pass in this example, because the name field is not empty, so the age field is not required*.



### Required without all

The field under validation must be present and not empty *only when* all the other specified fields are empty or not present.

```php
use KrisKuiper\Validator\Validator;

$data = [
    'name' => '',
    'hobby' => 'Puzzle',
    'age' => 67
];

$validator = new Validator($data);
$validator->field('name')->requiredWithoutAll('hobby', 'age');
```

*Note: validation will pass in this example, because the hobby and age fields are not empty, so the name field is not required*.
