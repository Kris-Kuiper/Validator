## 4.3 - Stopping on first validation failure (bail)

Sometimes you may wish to stop running validation rules on an attribute after the first validation failure. To do so, you can use the `bail()` method.

```php
$validator->field('fieldName')->bail()->min(1)->max(5);
```

This will prevent that the `max` rule is executed if the `min` rule fails validation.



*Unlike all other rules*, the order of the `bail` method does not matter. The example below will have the same result as the example above:

```php
$validator->field('fieldName')->min(1)->max(5)->bail();
```
