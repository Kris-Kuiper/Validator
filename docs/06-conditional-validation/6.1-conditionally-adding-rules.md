## 6.1 - Conditionally adding rules

Sometimes you may wish to add validation rules based on more complex conditional logic. For example, you may want to validate the incoming data by checking if the amount of products is higher than 99, then the reason of purchase should be filled in.

This can be achieved by using the `conditional()` method:

```php
use KrisKuiper\Validator\Validator;
use KrisKuiper\Validator\Blueprint\Events\Event;

$data = [
    'amount' => 100,
    'reason' => null
];

$validator = new Validator($data);
$validator
    ->field('reason')
    ->conditional(function(Event $event) {
        //Retrieve the value of the amount field
        return $event->getValue('amount') > 99
        
        //Or use the built-in validator
        return $event->field('amount')->isInt()->min(99)->isValid();
    })
    ->required()
    ->lengthMax(2000);

$validator->execute());
```

In this example, the validation will fail because the amount is higher than 99, so the reason field is required. If the amount was below 100, validation would have pass.



### Using multiple conditions

Although the last rule `isString`, in the example below, requires the provided data to be a `string` and the provided age field is an `interger` number (`25`), the validation still succeeds. This is because the last `conditional` rule returns `false`, so the `isString` rule is not executed.

```php
use KrisKuiper\Validator\Validator;
use KrisKuiper\Validator\Blueprint\Events\Event;

$data = ['age' => 25];
$validator = new Validator($data);

$validator
    ->field('age')
    ->conditional(static function () {
        return true;
    })
    ->min(10) //Should be at least 10
    ->conditional(static function () {
        return true;
    })
    ->max(30) //Should be a maximum of 30
    ->conditional(static function () {
        return false; //This will prevent executing the next rule
    })
    ->isString(); //This rule won't be executed

$validator->execute(); //Returns true
```
